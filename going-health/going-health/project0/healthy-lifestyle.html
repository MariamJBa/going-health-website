                        <p>Proper hydration is extremely important for your health. In fact, not drinking enough water
                            can lead to dehydration, which can cause fatigue, headaches, skin problems, muscle cramps,
                            low blood pressure and a rapid heart rate .</p>
                        <p>What’s more, prolonged dehydration can lead to serious complications like organ failure.
                            Experts generally recommend drinking several glasses of water per day to meet your hydration
                            needs. But while drinking water is very important, you can also get it from foods. There are
                            many healthy foods that can contribute a large amount of water to your diet.</p>
                            <p>Here are some fruits and vegetables that contain water :</p>

                        <h3>1. Watermelon</h3>
                        <h5>Water content: 92%</h5>
                        <p>Watermelon is very healthy and one of the most hydrating foods you can eat.</p>
                        <p>A 1-cup (154-gram) serving contains over a half cup (118 ml) of water, in addition to some
                            fiber and several important nutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin A and magnesium. It is
                            also quite low in calories, providing only 46 calories per cup.</p>
                        <p>Because of their high water content, watermelons have a very low calorie density. That means
                            that a relatively large portion of watermelon contains very few calories.</p>
                        <p>Foods with low calorie densities have been shown to help with weight loss by promoting
                            fullness and reducing appetite.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, watermelon is rich in powerful antioxidants, including lycopene.</p>
                        <p>You can add watermelon to your diet by consuming it as a refreshing snack or side dish. It’s
                            also commonly used to make salads.</p>

                        <h5>Water content: 91%</h5>
                        <p>Strawberries have a high water content, making them a very hydrating food.</p>
                        <p>Because about 91% of strawberries’ weight comes from water, eating them will contribute to
                            your daily water intake.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, strawberries provide lots of fiber, disease-fighting antioxidants and vitamins
                            and minerals, including vitamin C, folate and manganese.</p>
                        <p>It is easy to include strawberries in your diet by blending them into smoothies or
                            incorporating them into salads. They also make for a unique addition to sandwiches and
                            wraps.</p>

                        <h3>3. Cantaloupe</h3>
                        <h5>Water content: 90%</h5>
                        <p>Cantaloupe is a melon that’s extremely nutritious and may boost your health in several ways.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cantaloupe is a healthy fruit that provides a significant amount of water and many
                            health-promoting vitamins and minerals.</p>
                        <p>One cup (177 grams) of cantaloupe is composed of about 90% water and delivers more than a
                            half cup (118 ml) of water per serving.</p>
                        <p>One cup of cantaloupe also contains 2 grams of fiber, which works together with water to
                            promote fullness and reduce your appetite.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, cantaloupe is rich in vitamin A, providing 120% of your daily needs in a 1-cup
                            (177-gram) serving. Studies have shown that vitamin A may boost immune health by protecting
                            against infection.</p>
                        <p>You can consume cantaloupe plain or add it to salads, smoothies, yogurt or salsa. It also
                            makes a great side at breakfast.</p>

                        <h5>Water content: 89%</h5>
                        <p>Peaches are a very nutrient-dense and hydrating fruit.</p>
                        <p>Close to 90% of their weight is water. They also provide several important vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, vitamin C, B vitamins and potassium.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, eating peaches with the skin on may also contribute disease-fighting antioxidants like chlorogenic acid to your diet.</p>
                        <p>Peaches’ water and fiber contents are why they are so filling and low in calories, with only 60 calories in a medium peach.</p>
                        <p>It is simple to add peaches to your diet. They are commonly combined with smoothies and salads and also make a great addition to cottage cheese and yogurt.</p>

                        <h5>Water content: 88%</h5>
                        <p>Oranges are incredibly healthy and may provide a number of health benefits.</p>
                        <p>There is almost a half cup (118 ml) of water in one orange, along with fiber and several nutrients.</p>
                        <p>Oranges are also rich in disease-fighting antioxidants, including flavonoids, which may prevent cell damage by reducing inflammation.</p>
                        <p>The water and fiber in oranges may promote feelings of fullness, which is helpful for keeping your appetite under control.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, regularly eating citrus fruits like oranges may protect against kidney stones. This is because the citric acid they contain can bind with stone-forming calcium oxalate, helping flush it out of the body.</p>

                        <h5>Water content:95%</h5>
                        <p>Cucumbers are another healthy and hydrating food to include in your diet.</p>
                        <p>They are made up almost entirely of water and also provide a small amount of some nutrients, such as vitamin K, potassium and magnesium.</p>
                        <p>Compared to other water-rich vegetables, cucumbers are one of the lowest in calories. There are only 8 calories in a half-cup (52-gram) serving, and their water content makes them very refreshing.</p>
                        <p>You can eat a relatively large portion of cucumbers without adding a significant number of calories to your diet, which is helpful for maintaining your weight.</p>
                        <p>It’s easy to incorporate cucumbers into your diet. They are commonly added to salads and sandwiches.</p>

                        <h5>Water content: 96%</h5>
                        <p>Lettuce has several health-promoting properties.</p>
                        <p>One cup (72 grams) of lettuce provides more than a quarter cup (59 ml) of water, in addition to 1 gram of fiber. It also provides 5% of your daily needs for folate.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, lettuce is high in vitamins K and A, both of which have been studied for their roles in keeping your bones and immune system healthy.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the combination of water and fiber in lettuce makes it very filling for a low number of calories. There are only 10 calories in a 1-cup (72-gram) serving.</p>
                        <p>You can easily add lettuce to your diet by using it to make salads. Additionally, you can use it as a “bun” for burgers or wrap instead of a tortilla to substitute for less-hydrating grains.</p>

                        <p>A 1-cup (124-gram) serving of chopped zucchini contains more than 90% water and provides 1 gram of fiber. Both these components are great for keeping you full.</p>
                        <p>And as a result of its high water content, zucchini is fairly low in calories by volume, with only 20 calories in 1 cup (124 grams).</p>
                        <p>Eating zucchini will contribute several nutrients to your diet, especially vitamin C, since 1 cup (124 grams) of it contains 35% of your daily needs.</p>
                        <p>Vitamin C is essential for a healthy immune system and may help protect against a number of diseases.</p>
                        <p>To include zucchini in your diet, eat it on its own as a side dish or add it to soups, salads. You can also cut it into strips to create “noodles” that you can use as an alternative to regular pasta.</p>
